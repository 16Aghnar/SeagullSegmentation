# SeagullSegmentation
various techniques to segment a picture I took in Bergen, Norway

##K-means

classic k-means algo ran on the pixels (RGB image in input)

##Morphological gradient

Computation of the morphological gradient with a grayscale image in input. It consists of the difference between the dilatation and the erosion (in Minkowski's definition) of the input image.
